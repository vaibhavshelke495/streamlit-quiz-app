# streamlit-quiz-app
The Streamlit Quiz App is an interactive web-based application developed using Python and Streamlit, designed to deliver a smooth and engaging quiz experience for users. The application presents multiple-choice questions in a clean and intuitive interface, allowing users to select answers, navigate through questions, and receive instant feedback in the form of a final score.

The project focuses on implementing core Python programming concepts such as conditional logic, loops, data structures (lists and dictionaries), and state management to track user responses and calculate scores accurately. Streamlit’s components are used to create an interactive front end without requiring traditional web development skills, making the application lightweight and easy to deploy.

From a functional perspective, the app handles user input dynamically, ensures smooth question flow, and displays results immediately after quiz completion. The design emphasizes usability and clarity, making it suitable for educational and practice-based use cases. Additionally, the project demonstrates how a Python application can be converted into a fully functional web app using Streamlit.

This project also showcases practical experience in project structuring, dependency management, and application deployment using Streamlit Community Cloud. Overall, the Streamlit Quiz App highlights problem-solving ability, logical thinking, and hands-on experience in building interactive Python applications from scratch.
